## Sensors

As from v0.7.1, this integration contains show it's first sensor: current volume. The sensor is available for every zone. 

**Prerequisite: make sure you are using UC Firmware 2.7.1 or higher.**

After running setup, you can select an extra entity: sensor.

Like that you can have the volume visible without adjusting it.

Plan is to make audio/video sensors available in future releases, but that needs some more investigation so no promises :)

_note: after installing a new version of the integration or after a reboot of the remote, it might be needed to close screen on the remote and enter the already active activity again to get the sensor to work, hit next to go to the next song and trigger refresh of the album art_
