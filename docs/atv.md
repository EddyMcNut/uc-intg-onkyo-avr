### Apple TV activity

To set up an Activity for AppleTV, have a look at these screenshots:

- On sequence, Input source: `input-selector stm` (or whatever input you have assigned in your AVR for Apple TV)

  ![](../screenshots/appletv-on.png)

- User inerface, add mediawidget for the AVR with maximum size
